## Please read and agree with the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) first.

For students at Oakton High School, please remember to follow the [Oakton's Honor Code](https://oaktonhs.fcps.edu/academics/honor-code). The reason I'm making these code public is to make sharing my work with the instructor easier, while also telling the open source community I'm between a rock and a hard place--having my homework done must be my priority, but I still want to work on the [translation project](https://github.com/ApolloZhu/Developing-iOS-10-Apps-with-Swift). Therefore, I'm **NOT** intended to allow **ANY OTHER** student to copy my work. If you would like to cite my work as one of your used sources, please follow the procedure indicated in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.
