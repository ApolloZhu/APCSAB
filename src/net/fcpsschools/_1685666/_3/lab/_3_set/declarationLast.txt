We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of 
America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the 
Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions,
do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of 
these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United 
Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent 
States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the 
British Crown, and that all political connection between them 
and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally 
dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have 
full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, 
establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which 
Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this 
Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine 
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our 
Fortunes and our sacred Honor.
